# a summary about you
summary: '
Born and raised in OC, California, I learned from my immigrant parents the importance of work ethic, integrity, and enjoying life. Life is all about the roles and relationships we find ourselves in, and I’m always working to build upon these by being genuine and intentional.

I’m interested in integrating empathy into the intricacies and strategies of data science in order to bring about insights that incite constructive change. The key to unlocking the benefits of data is the bridge of understanding that links to human intuition. What is it about data that you’re passionate about? Let’s chat!'
